# RiverbedParsing
This script takes a list of Riverbed Steelheads, and pulls the optimisation stats.
The resulting data is parsed and fed in to a csv file for review. Individual host files 
are created in the same directory as the script and runtime files that contain more info
that is useful to assess the performance of the SH.
